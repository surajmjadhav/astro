[Astro](https://astro.build/) is used as the framework with the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) documentation theme applied. The Astro codebase can be found at `./docs/` within the repo.

The labs and guides are written in Markdown, which are located in the `./docs/src/content/docs/` directory.

New pages added to the existing directories will be automatically added to the sidebar. If a new section (directory) is required, this must be added to the `./docs/astro.config.mjs` file to be included in the sidebar.

Images should be added to the `./docs/src/assets/images/` directory and can be linked via the relative following path `../../../assets/images/`, assuming that the document with the reference is within a first level directory within `./docs/src/content/docs/`.

The website will be built from the contents of the `./docs/` directory.

The PR will have automated tests and checked performed again it and will be reviewed by the owning team.

If approved, the changes will be merged into the `main` branch and the changes will trigger the live labs website to be rebuilt and deployed to GitHub Pages.
