2) The folder listed below contains a configuration backup of the network devices. Over time, this folder eats free space. Any previous backup files can be erased after approval from the NOC team and make sure that a backup is available for this folder.

      E:\Program Files (x86)\CatTools3\Reports\ConfigChanges\CivicaUK

3) Daily backups of network devices are scheduled and executed. Therefore, prior authorisation from the NOC team would be required before the server shut down or restart.
