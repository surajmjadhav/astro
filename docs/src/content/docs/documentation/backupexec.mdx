### Introduction

   **Purpose:**

   The purpose of the backup solution is to ensure the secure and reliable preservation of critical data. This process is designed to protect against data loss due to accidental deletion, hardware failure, corruption, or other unforeseen issues by creating copies of essential files and storing them in a designated backup location.

   **Scope:**

   Backup procedure is applicable to important operational servers available at Notus site
   
   The IT infrastructure - 4 team is taking care of backups which is based on tape solution in which data is copied to an LTO-7 tape using a HPE MSL2024 Tape Library with 1 Tape Drive. The backup software currently in use is Veritas Backup Exec 22.0 Rev. 1193 (64 bit). The backup process contains options for both full and incremental backups depending on the defined schedule and requirements.

   In addition to that in case of disaster recovery situation same backup set is configured over resilience DC site in Mumbai (MUDC).
