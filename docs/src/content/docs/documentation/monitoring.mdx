### Monitoring

Systems are monitored by Zabbix

Zabbix can be accessed via [http://svr-zabbix-7.civica.root.local/zabbix/](http://svr-zabbix-7.civica.root.local/zabbix/)

1. "Dashboard" view gives you an overview of any issues. Monitoring > Dashboard > "Dashboard" 

2. All issue, covering servers, devices, or services being monitored in Zabbix will be shown here

3. Upto 15 minutes should pass to see if the issue resolves itself. Once 15 Minutes have passed, and the issue is still showing, a case should be raised via [Employee Service Cloud Analyst console](https://civicainternal.lightning.force.com/) according to priority table mentioned below.

| Severity | Color | Priority |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
