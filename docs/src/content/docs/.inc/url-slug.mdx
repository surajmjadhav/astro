:::note[URL Slug]
 URL slug format is a human readable name that provides a good insight into what something does or what content it provides, whilst being short and usable almost anywhere. Follow this guidance...

- Based on the full title of the target
- Keep it short - use abbreviations and acronyms where they are commonly understood and not ambiguous
- Ignore any punctuation or other special characters
- Replace spaces with a hyphen `-`
- Use only lowercase

| Title | Slug |
| -- | -- |
| Fix logon issues | `fix-logon-issues` |
| Help & Support | `help-support` - though an automatic slugger would generate `help--support` |
| It's a Great Article | `its-a-great-article` |
